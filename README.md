<b>Arsenic in US correctional facility drinking water, 2006-2011</b>

<b>Introduction:</b>
Little is known about the quality of drinking water in US correctional facilities (e.g. detention centers, prisons, jails, etc.). Our objective was to determine if incarcerated persons are at risk for chronic, elevated arsenic exposure relative to the non-incarcerated US population, particularly in the Southwestern US where public water and groundwater arsenic concentrations are high compared to the rest of the US. Our objective was to estimate drinking water arsenic exposure in US correctional facilities to determine the risk for chronic, elevated water arsenic exposure among the incarcerated compared to the non-incarcerated population in the Southwestern US. Using the most recent publicly available EPA data, we compared distributions of water arsenic concentrations for all other CWSs versus CWSs exclusively serving correctional facilities in the Southwestern US.
